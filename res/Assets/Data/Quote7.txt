"<p>I think that my Jewish identity makes Israel feel very personal. I agree with many of the common criticisms of Israel's government and policies, but I feel very emotionally attached to the country in a way that makes it difficult for me ...  I think it's very difficult for non-Jews in the US to understand what it means for Jews to have a true homeland.</p>"
