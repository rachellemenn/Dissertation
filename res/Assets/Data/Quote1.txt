"<p>My husband is a rich handsome Jewish doctor. I married him, not because he was a doctor (being handsome was very important), but because he had values that matched mine. He wanted to focus on family over career, be actively involved at home and our Jewish community. Being part of a Jewish community is a huge part of my Jewish identity because so many traditions and structures in Judaism are based on community and I think community really fuels a continued passion for Judaism. </p>"
