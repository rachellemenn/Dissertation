I consider them both religious and cultural, as I consider my Judaism both my religion and my ethnicity. \n I have a stronger connection to the religious aspects of being a Jew than most of my millennial Jewish friends do, but I still think that the majority of our traditions truly do combine religious with cultural. \n Fasting on Yom Kippur, for instance, makes me feel closer to the Jewish community around me - I fast for religious reasons and given the tradition dictated by Judaism, but the experience of fasting is a cultural one as well.
