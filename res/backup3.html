                                <p> The United States of America was founded on the principle of freedom and, by extension, 
                                    freedom of religion. However, the country’s Christian origins have remained a constant 
                                    dominant in the religious makeup of the United States. Today, the Abrahamic monotheistic 
                                    religions remain the most prominent with about 70 percent of religious citizens identifying 
                                    as Christian, 1.9 percent identifying as Jewish and 0.9 percent identifying as Muslim <!--(source) -->. 
                                    While the world history of these three religions has often intertwined in messy and unpleasant ways, 
                                    their history within the United States has been slightly different. Though religious freedom has not 
                                    always been total or constant in America — particularly for Judaism, Islam 
                                    and non-Protestant Christian denominations — it is perhaps one of the few places in the world these 
                                    religions have managed relatively successful coexistence <!--(source) -->. Immigrants from around the 
                                    world, particularly those fleeing persecution, have found solace in the melting pot community of the 
                                    United States. Such an environment has spurred trends of detachment amongst second and 
                                    third generation children of immigrants from the experiences their families and ancestors 
                                    faced outside of the United States <!--(source) -->. </p>

                                <p>Though Jews compose just under 2 percent of the overall United States population, 
                                    it is the largest Jewish community in the world, second to Israel <!--(source)-->. 
                                    The perception of America as an asylum for persecuted groups served as the basis for 
                                    much of the immigration to the United States <!--(source)-->. Heavy periods of Jewish 
                                    immigration often occurred in parallel to particularly poor conditions in different areas 
                                    of the globe. Jews have been present in the United States since the 1700s when <div data-tooltip="Sephardic Jews">Sephardic Jewish</div> 
                                    immigrants arrived in staggered groups. However, the major influxes of Jewish immigrants, 
                                    in the 1800s, and again in the early 20th century <!--(source)-->, mainly consisted of <div data-tooltip="Ashkenazi Jews">Ashkenazi 
                                    Jews</div> prompted by bouts of anti-Semitism across Eastern Europe <!--(source)-->. Even with the 
                                    obvious growth of the Jewish American community, the absence of an explicit definition of a Jewish 
                                    identity has posed a unique difficulty in collating census data over the 
                                    last century <!--(source)-->.</p>

                                <p>As for many groups of immigrants, New York served as a hub for Jewish immigrants. The New York 
                                    Community expanded across the northeast of the United States and has a very dense Jewish population.
                                    Today, the northeast, and New York in particular, hosts the largest Jewish community in the world 
                                    after Tel Aviv. Over the years, Jews have spread across the United States, though remain 
                                    congregated around large metropolitan areas. Other notable Jewish American communities include 
                                    Florida down south and LA on the west coast. Jewish populations remain coastal with very few large 
                                    Jewish populations in the Midwest. There are several practical reasons for these concentrations of 
                                    Jewish communities. In addition to better education and employment opportunities, metropolitan areas 
                                    simplify cultural and religious lifestyle requirements. Proximity to a <div data-tooltip="Synagogue">synagogue</div>, within 
                                    walking distance, is vital for more <div data-tooltip="Jewish religion: Denominations">observant Jews</div>,
                                    particularly during the <div data-tooltip="Jewish Holidays">holidays</div>. 
                                    Furthermore, the larger a community, the more accessible <div data-tooltip="Kosher">kosher food</div> 
                                    (in stores and restaurants) becomes – even at establishments run by non-Jews. In areas less 
                                    populated with Jews, lack of access to these amenities makes it difficult for those with more
                                    observant lifestyles to live comfortably. Furthermore, living around other Jews solidifies a 
                                    Jewish identity and increases dating and marriage opportunities. New York City is commonly a setting 
                                    for the dating scene amongst more religious Jews from around the world. <!--(source)-->. 
                                    Despite this, smaller Jewish communities across the United States are growing, due to <div data-tooltip="Hasidic">Hasidic</div> 
                                    Jews sending missionaries to areas with no congregation to build an official community

                                <p>The evolution of the Jewish American identity has been shaped by generational differences in 
                                    experiences and social conditions. Jewish American culture particularly flourished with the 
                                    generation of immigrants that arrived at the beginning of the <div data-tooltip="Jews in the 20th century">20th century</div>. 
                                    This group of immigrants became part of the working class as factory workers, seamstresses 
                                    and small business owners <!--(source)-->, of establishments such as the <div data-tooltip="Jewish stereotypes – Jewish Deli">Jewish deli</div>, 
                                    which created the foundation for some of the most well-known Jewish-American cultural 
                                    stereotypes. However, assimilation through education <!--(source)-->  allowed Jews to move up in the
                                    American class system and resulted in future generations of Jews becoming particularly dominant in 
                                    upper-class professions and some of the top earners in the United States <!--(source)-->. During this 
                                    time, many Jewish American leaders encouraged newcomers to embrace Judaism as an ethnic and cultural 
                                    identity rather than emphasise the religious. But by the mid-20th century, religious participation 
                                    increased as more Jews achieved a comfortable position in American society, economically and socially
                                    <!--(source)-->. Throughout the last century, specific elements of a Jewish American identity have 
                                    fluctuated. Of most concern to leaders within the American, and wider, Jewish community are the 
                                    rising popularity of interfaith marriages and the increasing disconnect between Jewish Americans 
                                    and Israel. </p>

                                <p>Procuring an accurate count of Jews is complex partly because Judaism has such a broad definition. 
                                    In the most rudimental terms, a Jewish identity is composed of religion, ancestry and culture 
                                    <!--(source)-->. Abraham, the first of the three <div data-tooltip="Jewish Religion: Patriarchs">patriarchs</div> of Judaism, was the 
                                    first Jew and the ancestor to the entire Jewish nation. Therefore, all Jews are bound by an ancestral 
                                    tie. Judaism states that the biological connection is passed from the mother and recognises anyone 
                                    with a Jewish mother as a Jew, regardless of their religious beliefs. Abraham became a Jew because he 
                                    rejected the pagan religion of his time and devoted himself to God. Subsequently, Judaism wholly stems
                                    from a belief in God, religious scripture and <div data-tooltip="Jewish Religion: Halakhic Law">halakhic law</div>, both God-mandated and rabbinic. 
                                    Despite the firm presence of both religion and ancestry in the core of Jewish culture, 
                                    Jewish culture is also the manifestation of shared beliefs, traditions, history, 
                                    experiences and circumstance. </p>
                            </section>
                            <section class = "step">
                                <!-- <div class ="title">Section 2.2</div> -->
                                <!--Viz 6  -->
                                <p>The three pillars of a Jewish identity — culture, religion and ancestry — are constant, but vary 
                                    in hierarchy and specific elements within every individual. Whilst Jewish microcultures directly 
                                    impact an identity; certain personality traits, mannerisms, beliefs and lifestyle choices have 
                                    become quite consistent across nationalities, denominations and generations. For instance, whether 
                                    there is a personal connection to Israel, the potential for a connection is an imperative element 
                                    of a Jewish identity. Furthermore, the collective history of tragedy and oppression is directly 
                                    reflected in a Jewish identity, a concept exhibited in Jewish humour which often takes the form 
                                    of self-deprecating, complaining anecdotes with subtle humorous undertones. This is exemplified 
                                    in an old Jewish joke which articulates that in Jewish tradition, a foetus is not considered 
                                    viable until after it graduates from medical school. This reflects the high demands of parents 
                                    (specifically <div data-tooltip="Jewish stereotypes:  Overbearing Mothers">overbearing mothers</div>), but also touches on the Jewish mentality of education 
                                    as a means of survival. The joke also encapsulates some of the <div data-tooltip="Jewish stereotypes: Specific to America">Jewish American 
                                    stereotypes</div> that have become a norm in pop culture.</p>

The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred.</p>

                                <p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.

True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.

                                <p>Whilst Jewish American Millennials are comparatively less religious than previous generations 
                                    <!--(source)-->, this is not exclusive to Judaism. Data shows wider patterns of rejecting religion 
                                    across the entire millennial generation. NYU professor <!--(source: in a Pew Research interview)-->  
                                    explains that millennials are being raised differently to previous generations, with more 
                                    encouragement towards a mentality of independence and self-thinking <!--(source)-->. 
                                    To an extent, this is applicable to Jewish American millennials — the freedom of thought 
                                    and religion provided by both parents and government <!--(source)-->. 
                                    Furthermore, by denouncing religion, millennials are not necessarily rejecting God, but 
                                    traditional institutions. Data demonstrates that millennials are much less trusting of 
                                    any formal institutions, including the government, universities and religious establishments. 
                                    It does not seem particularly common amongst millennial Jewish Americans to totally disassociate 
                                    themselves with Judaism <!--(source)-->. Rather, because Judaism is much more than a synagogue 
                                    and a <div data-tooltip="Jewish Religion: Rabbi">rabbi</div>, millennials can still maintain their Judaism without having to commit to a

                                <p>Geography significantly impacts identity <!--(source)-->.  American-born Jews have had the luxury of 
                                    growing up without fear of persecution whilst Soviet-born Jews grew up in an environment that 
                                    forced them to hide their Jewish ethnicity and, in many cases, their religious beliefs. 
                                    Whilst the communist regime enforced atheism, Jews were always singled out as an independent 
                                    ethnicity. Anti-Semitism in the USSR was not based on religion, but rather highlighted the 
                                    ancestral and cultural aspects. It was noted in passports and a quota on Jewish employees 
                                    and students was enforced by companies and universities respectively <!--(source)-->. 
                                    So, despite a ban on religion, Jews were unable to forget that they were Jewish. 
                                    Though some Jews from the Soviet Union renounced Judaism completely, many chose to focus 
                                    on their Jewish ethnicity and culture. This both strengthened and secularised many traditions 
                                    which manifested in the production of art, music, literature as well as collective values 
                                    with an emphasis on marrying Jews and receiving an education. Whilst there is a larger 
                                    portion of Jewish millennials with American-born parents, there is still a significant 
                                    portion with immigrant parents. Family is a vital influence in the development of an 
                                    identity, but whether the mentality of Soviet-born parents impacts how their 
                                    American-raised children perceive their Jewish identity is unclear <!--(source)-->. 
                                    In her article discussing the Pew Survey, Megan <!--(source)--> 
                                    expresses how the influence of immigrant parents impacts the child, 
                                    but that impact fades over time.</p>

                                    since its <div data-tooltip="Jewish Holidays: Israeli Independence Day">inception</div> in 1948,
                                    Israel has been in constant <div data-tooltip="Modern Judaism: Israel-Arab Conflict">conflict</div> with the 
                                    Palestinians and its neighbouring countries. The constant threat to Israel’s survival 
                                    has created a divide amongst Jews, particularly in the United States. Many immigrants 
                                    came to the States with assimilation as a priority. When they found themselves in a 
                                    country that provided everything the idea of Israel represented, the necessity of 
                                    a Jewish state became less imperative. Though many maintained loyalties to an Israeli 
                                    state, the same sentiments were not necessarily passed down to future generations 
                                    <!--(source)-->. Furthermore, Jews in other parts of the world, as well as immigrants

And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright.</p>

                                    followed by a meal which includes singing, eating and some more prayers. Shabbat 
                                    dinner on Friday nights often doubles as a family dinner and Shabbat traditions 
                                    can be a cultural act, though it often has more religious connotations <!--(source)-->. 
                                    As such, following this tradition is much more common amongst religious Jews. However, 
                                    the secularisation of Shabbat is common and is often seen in pop culture 
                                    (the UK show ‘Friday Night Dinner’ centres on Shabbat but features a secular family). 
                                    Though the basic principle of Shabbat is a day of rest, the secular forms of Shabbat 
                                    often strip away most religious significance and focus on just the meal. </p>

                                    at the synagogue and a 25-hour fast is imposed to place the focus on atoning sins. 
                                    Despite being one of the more physically straining traditions, there is a significant number 
                                    of non-religious fast observers, though more Jews by religion fast. To evaluate the true 
                                    secularisation of the tradition, it would be beneficial to determine how many of the fasters 
                                    also attend synagogue during Yom Kippur. Regardless, the data indicates that fasting has

                                    Whilst specific traditions may vary between ethnicities, <div data-tooltip="Jewish religion: Denominations">denominations</div> and sects, 
                                    the general meaning and history of each holiday and tradition remains the same. The way 
                                    Jews may connect to their Judaism is significantly influenced by where and how they grew up. 
                                    Not just their families, but the Jewish community around them. Growing up around other 
                                    Jews and participating in Jewish-related events outside the synagogue could encourage 
                                    a connection to Judaism without religious affiliation. Since a Jewish identity ranges 
                                    such a wide spectrum, fostering Jewish communities often extends beyond a traditional 
                                    religious institution. Community has always been integral to Judaism – whether the 
                                    product of shared beliefs or shared experiences – and Jewish history indicates that 
                                    community is imperative to survival through oppression and tragedy <!--(source)-->. </p>

                                    also try to bring Jews closer to each other. Often, the religious weight of a synagogue 
                                    hinders its success in reaching out to all Jews, so other <div data-tooltip="Jewish Culture: Organisations">Jewish organisations</div> take on 
                                    the cause. Whilst many programmes are created through congregations, such as Sunday 
                                    school or certain youth groups, many are products of third-party organisations. 
                                    There are different types of Jewish organisations that encompass participation in 
                                    Jewish activities beyond religious services. Jewish education is provided through 
                                    Sunday school or <div data-tooltip="Jewish Culture: Full Time Jewish Education">full-time Jewish school</div> — whilst some combine Jewish studies with 
                                    traditional academic subjects, stricter versions referred to as Yeshiva (for boys) 
                                    and Seminary (for girls) focus only on religious and Jewish studies. There are also 
                                    many youth groups such as NFTY and NCSY which are operated by independent organisations 
                                    seeking to connect Jewish youth to their heritage and with each other. Programmes such 
                                    as summer camps and Birthright operate with the same intent. Stress on religion and 
                                    degree of observance vary from organisation to organisations. Some, such as 
                                    <div data-tooltip="Jewish culture: Birthright">Birthright</div>, provide a multitude of different options for the programme, 
                                    depending on level of observance <!--(source)-->. Though the visualisation indicates that Jews by 
                                    religion more commonly participate in external programmes, it is important to remember 
                                    that Jews by religion does not indicate denominational distinctions and even very 
                                    non-observant Jews can identify as religious.</p>

                                    there is little difference between participation numbers across generations. The data is only 
                                    indicative of whether Jewish Americans have ever participated in Jewish organisations, rather 
                                    than if they do in the present. Since most programmes are aimed at a specific age range, the chances 
                                    that a Jewish American participated in such a programme are high. Sunday school and full-time Jewish 
                                    schools encourage a Jewish education whilst Jewish youth groups and camps connect Jews to 
                                    each other <!--(source)-->. What is changing with the current generation is the variety of options 
                                    available to youth as well as continued opportunities provided, as they age. New programmes experienced 
                                    by the millennial generation include the infamous Matzo Ball event in New York City <!--(source)--> and 
                                    <div data-tooltip="Jewish culture: Birthright">Birthright</div> which is only valid for Jews under 26. Opportunities for adults are expanding, including 
                                    synagogue-organised events and dating events and external apps, akin to that of JDate or JSwipe <!--(source)-->, 
                                    are gaining momentum. Whether or not the participation is as high as with youth groups, the fact that more 
                                    options are available already separates millennials from previous generations. Sociologically, youth are 
                                    more impressionable, so the likelihood that maintaining a Jewish identity is much higher if a Jew grows up

                                <p>The <div data-tooltip="Jewish Religion: Torah">Torah</div> only expressly forbids interfaith marriage between Jews and Canaanites for fear that any resulting 
                                    children would adopt the Canaanite faith. Rabbinical law extrapolated this to all non-Jews, forbidding any 
                                    interfaith marriage at all <!--(source)-->. The extremity to which this is upheld varies by <div data-tooltip="Jewish religion: Denominations">denomination</div>. 
                                    Though community acceptance varies by sect, more reform and reconstructionist rabbis will recognise and 
                                    even agree to perform an interfaith marriage ceremony whilst orthodox rabbis will not. However, potential 
                                    non-Jewish spouses that undergo an orthodox-approved conversion process will be recognised as Jewish and 
                                    the marriage as valid. If the spouse converts after a marriage, they must re-marry in an orthodox ceremony 
                                    for the marriage to be deemed valid <!--(source)-->. Though orthodox rabbis may not recognise an interfaith marriage, 
                                    if the mother is Jewish children from that union will be recognised as Jewish. Preserving the Jewish race faith is 
                                    important, and a non-Jewish spouse risks the loss of both in their Jewish counterpart and future children. 
                                    Another reason why rabbis discourage interfaith marriage is because, other than faith, Judaism is based on a set of 
                                    moral and ethical values which are not guaranteed in a non-Jewish spouse. Marrying outside the faith puts the couple 
                                    on shaky foundation and has a higher chance in resulting in an unsuccessful marriage, though measuring the comparative 
                                    success is difficult <!--(source)-->. In the same vein, rabbis will encourage anyone planning to convert for a marriage
                                    to be completely certain that the conversion would happen regardless. Converting for a person rather than for the 
                                    religion risks the same issues as marrying a non-Jew.</p>

                                <p>Determining whether a child is raised Jewish is an ambiguous task. Just as with identity, the definition for raising 
                                    Jewish children is on a spectrum. Technically, if the mother is Jewish, the child is born a Jew. However, depending 
                                    on what the parent considers to be religious or cultural, the definition of how a child is raised varies. Attending 
                                    <div data-tooltip="Synagogue">synagogue</div> or Sunday School does not automatically equate to a religious upbringing <!--(source)-->.   
                                    <br><br>Sociological studies have attempted to determine how children of immigrants differ from those with parents born 
                                    in the same country. Children of Soviet-born parents can create their Jewish identity, a freedom their parents lacked, 
                                    but growing up with that awareness emphasises the luxury of living in such an environment. Whereas children of American-born 
                                    parents are not necessarily exposed to this difference directly. What this data likely shows are Jewish parents who either 
                                    do not raise their children Jewish or raise them in a different denomination. This most likely stems from a personal 
                                    reassessment of Jewish identity or an interfaith marriage <!--(source)-->. </p>

                                <p>Whether or not children of interfaith marriages are ancestrally Jewish, their upbringing will vary from family to family. 
                                    Dual faith upbringing is common with interfaith marriages. From this, a micro-culture is created with concepts like 
                                    <div data-tooltip="Jewish Culture: Chrismukkah">Chrismukkah</div>. Chrismukkah accurately represents children of interfaith marriages who try to combine cultural aspects 
                                    from both sides of their family.  In marriages with conversions, children tend to be brought up <!--(source)--> as
                                    Jewish — culturally, ancestrally and religiously. Most marriages with conversions are done by religious Jews, so religion 
                                    is an integral part of raising the child <!--(source)-->. Alternatively, many Jewish parents in interfaith marriages might 
                                    define themselves as Jewish, but not raise their children Jewish. If it is the mother that is Jewish, the child will be 
                                    ancestrally Jewish, but not recognise that to its full extent due to the lack of religious and cultural Judaism in their 
                                    lives. Data suggests <!--(source)-->  there is a trend of interfaith-marriage children who grow up 
                                    and rediscover their Judaism later in life <!--(source)-->.</p>

        <div data-keyword="Sephardic Jews">
            Sephardi is one of the predominant Jewish sub-ethnicities. Sephardic Jews are
            originally from regions that form modern day Spain and Portugal, but were expelled
            during the Spanish Inquisition, often to areas with no other Jewish communities
            such as West Asia and North Africa. Today, Sephardic Jews also refers to Jewish
            communities from these parts of the world. Sephardic Jews have their own
            rabbinical council which has resulted in slightly different laws and variations of
            Jewish traditions. Sephardic Jews established some of the first Jewish communities
            in the United States, dating back to pre-colonial times. There was no mass
            immigration of Sephardic Jews, like those from Eastern Europe. Rather they trickled
            in. Today, the United States has the third largest Sephardic Jewish community in the
            world.
        </div>
        <div data-keyword="Ashkenazi Jews">
            Ashkenazi Jews form the second main Jewish sub-ethnicity alongside Sephardic
            Jews. Originally, they settled in parts of Germany and France, but since moved
            eastward and today, refers to Jews from the majority of Europe. Despite suffering
            from consistent anti-Semitism and oppression, Ashkenazi Jews played a significant
            role in the development of European culture and science. Ashkenazi Jews created
            the Yiddish language, a mix of German and Hebrew, from which many words have
            become commonplace, not just amongst Jews, but in colloquial English (i.e.
            schmuck). Huge influxes of Ashkenazi Jews came to America at various points, the
            most influential of which were the immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century.
        </div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish religion: Denominations">
            Judaism is split into four main religious movements – Orthodox, Conservative,
            Reconstructionist and Reform (the survey used as a basis for this project grouped
            the reconstructionist and reform movements together). The movements differ
            primarily on levels of observance and the interpretations of religious scripture and
            Jewish laws. Each denomination is further divided into different sects. Within the
            orthodox movement, there are many different sects all with very specific
            interpretations and complexities associated with each particular one. For instance,
            observant Jews, specifically orthodox, employ a dress code, keep kosher and
            observe Shabbat – but these might take different forms depending on the sect.
        </div>
        <div data-keyword="Synagogue">
            A synagogue is the Jewish house of assembly used for prayer, study of the Torah and
            for community gatherings. A synagogue is not imperative for prayer. Jewish law
            dictates that a minyan, ten men, need to be present, anywhere, in order to conduct
            group prayers. Though most praying can be done individually, a minyan is required
            to read the Torah and for certain holidays. The minimal traditional expectations of a
            synagogue include: a bimah (a platform from which the Torah is read and a rabbi
            conducts prayer) and an arc containing the Torah. Traditionally, both the bimah and
            the arc are situated so that the congregation faces east, towards Israel, during
            prayer. Whether Jerusalem is actually east is a point of argument.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Holidays">
            The Hebrew phrase ‘Yom Tov’ can refer to all Jewish holidays but is usually used to
            refer specifically to the holidays, or periods of time, during which all the activities
            prohibited on Shabbat are prohibited as well.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Kosher">
            Keeping kosher refers to following the Jewish dietary requirements as outlined by
            the Torah and accompanying rabbinical law. Kashrut only allows certain animals to
            be consumed (the most well-known items include pork and shellfish) and killed in a
            specific way. It is also forbidden to mix dairy with meat. Fish, eggs and all other food
            items are considered ‘pareve’, meaning neither dairy or meat. Kosher kitchens have
            separate dishes and cooking utensils for dairy and meat. If possible, separate sinks
            and counters are used or even two kitchens. In more modern times, the definition of
            kosher has extended to rabbi supervision for the preparation of processed or
            packaged foods, and regular inspections of any kosher establishments. The degree
            of strictness varies between sub-ethnicities, denominations and individual
            denominational sects.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Hasidic">
            Hasidic Jews arose as a religious group in Ukraine during the 18th century. Hassidism
            originated from a rabbi called the Bal Shem Tov and focuses on religion, observance
            and mysticism. Hassidic Jews have since branched out into multiple sects that
            disagree on the recognised customs.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jews in the 20th century">
            The majority of the early 20th century Jewish immigrants were Ashkenazi Jews from
            Eastern Europe. Ashkenazi Jewish rabbinical law, languages and traditions laid the
            foundation for modern-day Jewish American culture.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish stereotypes – Jewish Deli">
            The Jewish Deli is mostly associated with Jews of New York City. Immigrants who
            came to the United States from Europe opened up kosher delis that served Jewish
            variations of German and Eastern European food. Due to further popularisation by
            future generations of American-born Jews, Jewish deli food holds a firm presence in
            Jewish American culture.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Patriarchs">
            The Torah outlines three fathers and four mothers of Judaism. Abraham, the first
            Jew and his wife Sarah. The second father of Judaism is their son Isaac (Yitzchak) and
            his wife Rebekah (Rivkah). Yitzchak and Rivkah had twins, one of these twins, Jacob
            (Yaakov), is the third father of Judaism along with this wives Rachel and Leah.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Halakhic Law">
            Halakhic Law refers to both God-mandated law as well as rabbinical law. As with
            most religious scripture, there are various interpretations of the material. While
            some is universal across Judaism, the technicalities of others were (and continue to
            be) argued amongst Jewish leaders. Some is between sects and others between
            ethnic group of Jews. For instance, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews differ on which
            non-grains (i.e. rice, beans, non-grain seeds) are allowed during Passover. More
            sect-specific examples include whether women can wear trousers or whether using
            electricity counts as working on Shabbat. Disagreement on technicalities laid
            foundations for different branches of Judaism. Rabbinic law remains the main
            difference between sects of Judaism.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish stereotypes:  Overbearing Mothers">
            One of the more common pop culture stereotypes of Jewish culture is the caricature
            of overbearing mothers. Whilst this trope is quite consistent throughout cultures,
            specifically amongst immigrant mothers (source), Jewish mothers remain unique in
            that this mentality seems to have preserved over generations (source). Many Jewish
            anecdotes centre on the stereotype of overbearing Jewish mothers (and their
            persisting proffering of chicken soup).</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish culture: Inquisitive Minds">
            One of the more integral Jewish traits is an inquisitive mind and learning through
            discourse. It is embedded in the practice of studying Torah and is perpetuated
            through Jewish culture.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Torah">
            The Torah refers to the first five books of the Old Testament and is read at religious
            services throughout the year. It is not the only religious scripture in Judaism.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish stereotypes: specific to America">
            The success of the Jewish American pursuit of the American Dream and the resulting
            wealth bred new stereotypes that often appear in pop culture representation of
            Jewish Americans. This includes Jewish Americans as lawyers, doctors and
            Hollywood success stories. With these came the Jewish American Princess trope of
            spoiled girls wholly dependent on their fathers. These emphasise the lifestyle many
            Jewish families have.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Ancestry: The Jewish diaspora">
            The Jewish diaspora refers to the exile of the Jewish people from the ancestral
            homeland (Israel) and the subsequent dissipation across the globe. The diaspora is
            often furthered by the oppressive countries in which many Jewish communities
            resided. The Jewish diaspora is well documented in both religious scripture as well
            as global history.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Culture: Ethnic groups of Jews">
            Subsects of Jewish culture were created as a result of Jewish tradition mixing with
            the culture of the country in which those Jews resided. Some examples of such
            subsects of Jewish culture include: Bukharan (Central and West Asia), Eastern
            European (with a subsect specific to those from the Soviet Union), Persian and,
            recently, Israeli Jews.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Rabbi">
            A rabbi is someone knowledgeable in religious practices and laws. In more reform
            synagogues, women can be rabbis, however more often, rabbis are men. Rabbinical
            qualifications are considered equal to a bachelor�s degree and are earned by
            attending Yeshiva as well as rabbinical school. Though not always, many rabbis tend
            to specialise in certain areas of Judaism. Rabbis are hired by Jewish communities,
            though certified rabbis are not required to work as religious leaders. Unlike
            members of clergy in other religions, rabbis are not just community leaders � they
            are also teachers, judges and a source of advice and comfort.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish holidays: Passover">
            Passover is a holiday that celebrates the Jewish people�s escape from slavery in
            Egypt. It tells the story of how Moses became a leader, freed the Jews and helped
            them evade re-capture by the Egyptians. The holiday lasts seven days in Israel and
            eight days everywhere else (in the past, there was difficulty determining Israeli time
            from other parts of the world). No leavened bread is consumed during Passover;
            instead, Jews eat Matzah, an unleavened bread. This commemorates the part of the
            story when Jews were forced to run carrying unleavened dough on their shoulders
            which baked in the sun. Today, matzah is commercially produced into a cracker-like
            bread and consumed in lieu of any bread or grain.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Holidays: Passover Seder">
            In Hebrew, Seder means order which is the best way to describe this Passover
            tradition. A Seder is held the first two of the eight nights (or, in Israel, the first of the
            seven nights) of Passover and consists of telling the story through passages of text,
            song, food and activities.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Ancestry: Israel as the Promised Land">
            In the Torah, God first promises Israel to the Jewish people through Abraham.
            Throughout the Torah, this promise is referenced, and many stories feature patterns
            of the Jews trying to return to the promised land and then retreating into exile
            again. This reflects world history as Jews often attempted to return to the
            Palestinian area but were unsuccessful until 1948.</div>

        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Messiah">
            Mashiach (Messiah) is a core principle in Judaism. It is believed that once he arrives,
            all Jews will live in Israel and there will be world peace. Jews do not believe that
            Mashiach has arrived yet. learn more.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Holidays: Israeli Independence Day">
            Yom Haatzmaut, or Israeli Independence Day, is celebrated every year on the 9th of
            May and signifies the day Israel became a country in 1948. Yom Haatzmaut is
            different from most other Jewish holidays because it is not a religiously-mandated
            holiday or based on any religious scripture. It signifies the importance Israel plays in
            Jewish culture and how interwoven the religion, culture and ancestry are within
            Judaism.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish culture: Birthright">
            Taglit-Birthright is an organisation that was developed in the late 90s. It is funded by
            Jews from around the world and its aim is to provide Jews between the age of 13-26
            the opportunity to visit Israel for free. The organisation provides different
            programmes that include options for all denominations as well as activity-specific
            programmes (i.e. religious history, food, culture or outdoors). The programme has
            been criticised recently for excluding a trip to the Gaza strip as well as information
            regarding relations between Israel and Palestine from its itinerary (source).</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Culture: Tikkun Olam">
            Tikkun Olam is a Jewish concept that encompasses the personal and social
            responsibility of a Jew to behave morally and uphold Jewish values. A subsect of this
            concept is performing mitzvot – 613 good deeds listed in the Torah. Though some
            outline religious obligations, the majority formulate a behavioural value system.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Jewish duties">

            traditions and performing mitzvot. It is expected of every Jew once they become an

        <div data-keyword="Jewish Religion: Exodus">
            Exodus is the second book in the Torah. It outlines the Moses-led escape of the
            Jewish People from slavery in Egypt and their 40-year journey through the desert to
            Israel. Included in Exodus is the receival of the Ten Commandments as well as the
            oral version of the Torah and is considered the day the Hebrews officially became
            the Jewish nation. This story is celebrated during the Jewish holiday of Passover.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Holidays: Haggadah">
            The Haggadah is the guidebook for the Passover Seder. It provides instructions for
            the order, the story of Passover, the meaning behind each item, as well as songs and
            anecdotes. To understand the vast spectrum of religious and secular interpretations
            of Seders, see this reform version of the Haggadah and this more religious version.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Holidays:  Shabbat">
            Shabbat represents God’s day of rest in the Torah’s creation story. Since the Jewish
            calendar week begins on Sunday, the Jewish Shabbat is Saturday every week (unlike
            the Christian Sabbath which falls on Sunday). Shabbat begins on Friday night and
            incorporates several traditions that vary depending on the level of observance. At a
            primitive level, two candles are lit on Friday night to welcome the holiday, songs are
            sung and blessings are made over the wine and challah (traditional Shabbat bread).
            The next day, synagogue is often attended. More religious Jews do not work on
            Sabbath. ‘Work’ in the context of Jewish holidays includes no use of electricity or
            cars.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish holidays: Start Times">

        <div data-keyword="Jewish holidays: Yom Kippur">
            Yom Kippur is the day of Atonement and one of the four high holidays.
            Traditionally, a Jew will attend synagogue all day and fast for 25 hours so as
            to focus on atoning for their sins. Additionally, a shofar (a religious horn) is
            sounded during the day. Though all are viewed as essential parts of the
            holiday’s traditions, listening to the shofar is the only aspect that is
            considered a divine mitzvah and a requirement.</div>
        <div data-keyword="Jewish Culture: Organisations">
            <p>Other than the synagogue, there is a variety of popular Jewish American
                organisations. Sunday school is commonly run by synagogues – similar to
                Christian Sunday schools. it provides Jewish children with education on the
                Torah and Jewish holidays. Frequently, Jewish Sunday schools will also teach
                some Hebrew.</p>
            <p>Youth Organisations such as NFTY, NCSY and CTeen provide events centred
                around both Jewish holidays and non-specific events, to bring Jewish Youth
                together through Judaism. The level of observance varies between
                organisations.</p>
            <p>Jewish summer camps are often run by the same organisations. Though they
                vary between day camps and sleepaway camps — many have developed a
                stereotype of their own as being particularly lavish.</p>
            <p>Birthright is an organisation that is sponsored by Jews around the world to
                provide any Jews between 13-26 years old the opportunity for a free trip to
                Israel. The purpose is to reconnect estranged Jews to their homeland as well
                as to each other.</p>

        <div data-keyword="Jewish Culture: Full Time Jewish Education">
            Full-time Jewish schools provide Jewish Studies as part of the mandatory
            curriculum. Stricter Jews will send their children to schools that are
            exclusively in Jewish and Hebrew studies. Yeshiva refers to such schools for
            boys (and is usually a feeder school to rabbinic studies). Seminary is the
            female equivalent. Level of observance varies between different yeshivas
