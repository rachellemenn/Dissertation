"<p>Remembering the Holocaust is an important part of my Jewish identity because although it is not something I went through myself, hearing the stories of hardship and persecution that my close relatives went through in the Holocaust still impacts me and the way I perceive my identity in a meaningful way.</p> <p>When my grandparents and other Holocaust survivors tell stories of how they managed to not only survive - but keep their faith - the strength of their conviction to thrive as Jews inspires me to value and fully explore the Jewish identity that they fought for me to have."</p>
