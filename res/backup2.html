                                <p> The United States of America was founded on the principle of freedom and, by extension, 
                                    freedom of religion. However, the country’s Christian origins have remained a constant 
                                    dominant in the religious makeup of the United States. Today, the Abrahamic monotheistic 
                                    religions remain the most prominent with about 70 percent of religious citizens identifying 
                                    as Christian, 1.9 percent identifying as Jewish and 0.9 percent identifying as Muslim <!--(source) -->. 
                                    While the world history of these three religions has often intertwined in messy and unpleasant ways, 
                                    their history within the United States has been slightly different. Though religious freedom has not 
                                    always been total or constant in America — particularly for Judaism, Islam 
                                    and non-Protestant Christian denominations — it is perhaps one of the few places in the world these 
                                    religions have managed relatively successful coexistence <!--(source) -->. Immigrants from around the 
                                    world, particularly those fleeing persecution, have found solace in the melting pot community of the 
                                    United States. Such an environment has spurred trends of detachment amongst second and 
                                    third generation children of immigrants from the experiences their families and ancestors 
                                    faced outside of the United States <!--(source) -->. </p>

                                <p>Though Jews compose just under 2 percent of the overall United States population, 
                                    it is the largest Jewish community in the world, second to Israel <!--(source)-->. 
                                    The perception of America as an asylum for persecuted groups served as the basis for 
                                    much of the immigration to the United States <!--(source)-->. Heavy periods of Jewish 
                                    immigration often occurred in parallel to particularly poor conditions in different areas 
                                    of the globe. Jews have been present in the United States since the 1700s when <a>Sephardic Jewish</a> 
                                    immigrants arrived in staggered groups. However, the major influxes of Jewish immigrants, 
                                    in the 1800s, and again in the early 20th century <!--(source)-->, mainly consisted of <a>Ashkenazi 
                                    Jews</a> prompted by bouts of anti-Semitism across Eastern Europe <!--(source)-->. Even with the 
                                    obvious growth of the Jewish American community, the absence of an explicit definition of a Jewish 
                                    identity has posed a unique difficulty in collating census data over the 
                                    last century <!--(source)-->.</p>

                                <p>As for many groups of immigrants, New York served as a hub for Jewish immigrants. The New York 
                                    Community expanded across the northeast of the United States and has a very dense Jewish population.
                                    Today, the northeast, and New York in particular, hosts the largest Jewish community in the world 
                                    after Tel Aviv. Over the years, Jews have spread across the United States, though remain 
                                    congregated around large metropolitan areas. Other notable Jewish American communities include 
                                    Florida down south and LA on the west coast. Jewish populations remain coastal with very few large 
                                    Jewish populations in the Midwest. There are several practical reasons for these concentrations of 
                                    Jewish communities. In addition to better education and employment opportunities, metropolitan areas 
                                    simplify cultural and religious lifestyle requirements. Proximity to a <a>synagogue</a>, within 
                                    walking distance, is vital for more <a>observant Jews</a>, particularly during the <a>holidays</a>. 
                                    Furthermore, the larger a community, the more accessible <a>kosher</a> food 
                                    (in stores and restaurants) becomes – even at establishments run by non-Jews. In areas less 
                                    populated with Jews, lack of access to these amenities makes it difficult for those with more
                                    observant lifestyles to live comfortably. Furthermore, living around other Jews solidifies a 
                                    Jewish identity and increases dating and marriage opportunities. New York City is commonly a setting 
                                    for the dating scene amongst more religious Jews from around the world. <!--(source)-->. 
                                    Despite this, smaller Jewish communities across the United States are growing, due to <a>Hasidic</a> 
                                    Jews sending missionaries to areas with no congregation to build an official community
                                    <!--(source)-->. However, no other areas are on par with the 
                                    communities in New York, Miami and LA. </p>

                                <p>The evolution of the Jewish American identity has been shaped by generational differences in 
                                    experiences and social conditions. Jewish American culture particularly flourished with the 
                                    generation of immigrants that arrived at the beginning of the <a>20th century</a>. 
                                    This group of immigrants became part of the working class as factory workers, seamstresses 
                                    and small business owners <!--(source)-->, of establishments such as the <a>Jewish deli</a>, 
                                    which created the foundation for some of the most well-known Jewish-American cultural 
                                    stereotypes. However, assimilation through education <!--(source)-->  allowed Jews to move up in the
                                    American class system and resulted in future generations of Jews becoming particularly dominant in 
                                    upper-class professions and some of the top earners in the United States <!--(source)-->. During this 
                                    time, many Jewish American leaders encouraged newcomers to embrace Judaism as an ethnic and cultural 
                                    identity rather than emphasise the religious. But by the mid-20th century, religious participation 
                                    increased as more Jews achieved a comfortable position in American society, economically and socially
                                    <!--(source)-->. Throughout the last century, specific elements of a Jewish American identity have 
                                    fluctuated. Of most concern to leaders within the American, and wider, Jewish community are the 
                                    rising popularity of interfaith marriages and the increasing disconnect between Jewish Americans 
                                    and Israel. </p>

                                <!-- Viz 4 -->
                                <p>Procuring an accurate count of Jews is complex partly because Judaism has such a broad definition. 
                                    In the most rudimental terms, a Jewish identity is composed of religion, ancestry and culture 
                                    <!--(source)-->. Abraham, the first of the three <a>patriarchs</a> of Judaism, was the 
                                    first Jew and the ancestor to the entire Jewish nation. Therefore, all Jews are bound by an ancestral 
                                    tie. Judaism states that the biological connection is passed from the mother and recognises anyone 
                                    with a Jewish mother as a Jew, regardless of their religious beliefs. Abraham became a Jew because he 
                                    rejected the pagan religion of his time and devoted himself to God. Subsequently, Judaism wholly stems
                                    from a belief in God, religious scripture and <a>halakhic law</a>, both God-mandated and rabbinic. 
                                    Despite the firm presence of both religion and ancestry in the core of Jewish culture, 
                                    Jewish culture is also the manifestation of shared beliefs, traditions, history, 
                                    experiences and circumstance. </p>
                            </section>
                            <section class = "step">
                                <!-- <div class ="title">Section 2.2</div> -->
                                <!--Viz 6  -->
                                <p>The three pillars of a Jewish identity — culture, religion and ancestry — are constant, but vary 
                                    in hierarchy and specific elements within every individual. Whilst Jewish microcultures directly 
                                    impact an identity; certain personality traits, mannerisms, beliefs and lifestyle choices have 
                                    become quite consistent across nationalities, denominations and generations. For instance, whether 
                                    there is a personal connection to Israel, the potential for a connection is an imperative element 
                                    of a Jewish identity. Furthermore, the collective history of tragedy and oppression is directly 
                                    reflected in a Jewish identity, a concept exhibited in Jewish humour which often takes the form 
                                    of self-deprecating, complaining anecdotes with subtle humorous undertones. This is exemplified 
                                    in an old Jewish joke which articulates that in Jewish tradition, a foetus is not considered 
                                    viable until after it graduates from medical school. This reflects the high demands of parents 
                                    (specifically <a>overbearing mothers</a>), but also touches on the Jewish mentality of education 
                                    as a means of survival. The joke also encapsulates some of the <a>Jewish American 
                                    stereotypes</a> that have become a norm in pop culture.</p>

                                <p>He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred.</p>

                                <p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell! " He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think.</p>

                                <p>Whilst Jewish American Millennials are comparatively less religious than previous generations 
                                    <!--(source)-->, this is not exclusive to Judaism. Data shows wider patterns of rejecting religion 
                                    across the entire millennial generation. NYU professor <!--(source: in a Pew Research interview)-->  
                                    explains that millennials are being raised differently to previous generations, with more 
                                    encouragement towards a mentality of independence and self-thinking <!--(source)-->. 
                                    To an extent, this is applicable to Jewish American millennials — the freedom of thought 
                                    and religion provided by both parents and government <!--(source)-->. 
                                    Furthermore, by denouncing religion, millennials are not necessarily rejecting God, but 
                                    traditional institutions. Data demonstrates that millennials are much less trusting of 
                                    any formal institutions, including the government, universities and religious establishments. 
                                    It does not seem particularly common amongst millennial Jewish Americans to totally disassociate 
                                    themselves with Judaism <!--(source)-->. Rather, because Judaism is much more than a synagogue 
                                    and a <a>rabbi</a>, millennials can still maintain their Judaism without having to commit to a 
                                    traditional religious institution. </p>

                                <p>Geography significantly impacts identity <!--(source)-->.  American-born Jews have had the luxury of 
                                    growing up without fear of persecution whilst Soviet-born Jews grew up in an environment that 
                                    forced them to hide their Jewish ethnicity and, in many cases, their religious beliefs. 
                                    Whilst the communist regime enforced atheism, Jews were always singled out as an independent 
                                    ethnicity. Anti-Semitism in the USSR was not based on religion, but rather highlighted the 
                                    ancestral and cultural aspects. It was noted in passports and a quota on Jewish employees 
                                    and students was enforced by companies and universities respectively <!--(source)-->. 
                                    So, despite a ban on religion, Jews were unable to forget that they were Jewish. 
                                    Though some Jews from the Soviet Union renounced Judaism completely, many chose to focus 
                                    on their Jewish ethnicity and culture. This both strengthened and secularised many traditions 
                                    which manifested in the production of art, music, literature as well as collective values 
                                    with an emphasis on marrying Jews and receiving an education. Whilst there is a larger 
                                    portion of Jewish millennials with American-born parents, there is still a significant 
                                    portion with immigrant parents. Family is a vital influence in the development of an 
                                    identity, but whether the mentality of Soviet-born parents impacts how their 
                                    American-raised children perceive their Jewish identity is unclear <!--(source)-->. 
                                    In her article discussing the Pew Survey, Megan <!--(source)--> 
                                    expresses how the influence of immigrant parents impacts the child, 
                                    but that impact fades over time.</p>

                                <p>Jews have idealised Israel as a utopian homeland where the Jewish people could finally come

                                    forced into oppressive regimes throughout the Jewish diaspora <!--(source)-->. However, 
                                    since its <a>inception</a> in 1948, Israel has been in constant <a>conflict</a> with the 
                                    Palestinians and its neighbouring countries. The constant threat to Israel’s survival 
                                    has created a divide amongst Jews, particularly in the United States. Many immigrants 
                                    came to the States with assimilation as a priority. When they found themselves in a 
                                    country that provided everything the idea of Israel represented, the necessity of 
                                    a Jewish state became less imperative. Though many maintained loyalties to an Israeli 
                                    state, the same sentiments were not necessarily passed down to future generations 
                                    <!--(source)-->. Furthermore, Jews in other parts of the world, as well as immigrants 
                                    in the present day, have a connection to Israel that is much more defined than that 
                                    of Jewish Americans <!--(source)-->. In the late 90s a programme called <a>Birthright</a> 
                                    was founded to rekindle the millennial generation’s connection to Israel and, though the

                                    from around the world, older generations seem to have a stronger loyalty to the Jewish

                                    community leaders have been concerned over the ever-growing separation, often blaming the

                                <p>When Jewish children come of age, they become bar (boy) or bat (girl) mitzvah at ages 13 and 12 
                                    respectively. This signifies that they are now responsible for their moral, religious and

And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright.</p>

                                <p><a>Shabbat</a> takes place <a>Friday night to Saturday night</a>. Shabbat candles, one of 
                                    several traditions associated with the holiday, are lit and blessed at sunset and is 
                                    followed by a meal which includes singing, eating and some more prayers. Shabbat 
                                    dinner on Friday nights often doubles as a family dinner and Shabbat traditions 
                                    can be a cultural act, though it often has more religious connotations <!--(source)-->. 
                                    As such, following this tradition is much more common amongst religious Jews. However, 
                                    the secularisation of Shabbat is common and is often seen in pop culture 
                                    (the UK show ‘Friday Night Dinner’ centres on Shabbat but features a secular family). 
                                    Though the basic principle of Shabbat is a day of rest, the secular forms of Shabbat 
                                    often strip away most religious significance and focus on just the meal. </p>

                                    of the few that does not encourage celebration. The whole day is usually spent praying 
                                    at the synagogue and a 25-hour fast is imposed to place the focus on atoning sins. 
                                    Despite being one of the more physically straining traditions, there is a significant number 
                                    of non-religious fast observers, though more Jews by religion fast. To evaluate the true 
                                    secularisation of the tradition, it would be beneficial to determine how many of the fasters 
                                    also attend synagogue during Yom Kippur. Regardless, the data indicates that fasting has

                                <p>The vast majority of Jewish holidays and traditions are rooted in religion or <a>halakha</a>. 
                                    Whilst specific traditions may vary between ethnicities, <a>denominations</a> and sects, 
                                    the general meaning and history of each holiday and tradition remains the same. The way 
                                    Jews may connect to their Judaism is significantly influenced by where and how they grew up. 
                                    Not just their families, but the Jewish community around them. Growing up around other 
                                    Jews and participating in Jewish-related events outside the synagogue could encourage 
                                    a connection to Judaism without religious affiliation. Since a Jewish identity ranges 
                                    such a wide spectrum, fostering Jewish communities often extends beyond a traditional 
                                    religious institution. Community has always been integral to Judaism – whether the 
                                    product of shared beliefs or shared experiences – and Jewish history indicates that 
                                    community is imperative to survival through oppression and tragedy <!--(source)-->. </p>

                                <p>Programmes with the intent to bring both estranged and connected Jews closer to Judaism 
                                    also try to bring Jews closer to each other. Often, the religious weight of a synagogue 
                                    hinders its success in reaching out to all Jews, so other <a>Jewish organisations</a> take on 
                                    the cause. Whilst many programmes are created through congregations, such as Sunday 
                                    school or certain youth groups, many are products of third-party organisations. 
                                    There are different types of Jewish organisations that encompass participation in 
                                    Jewish activities beyond religious services. Jewish education is provided through 
                                    Sunday school or <a>full-time Jewish school</a> — whilst some combine Jewish studies with 
                                    traditional academic subjects, stricter versions referred to as Yeshiva (for boys) 
                                    and Seminary (for girls) focus only on religious and Jewish studies. There are also 
                                    many youth groups such as NFTY and NCSY which are operated by independent organisations 
                                    seeking to connect Jewish youth to their heritage and with each other. Programmes such 
                                    as summer camps and Birthright operate with the same intent. Stress on religion and 
                                    degree of observance vary from organisation to organisations. Some, such as 
                                    <a>Birthright</a>, provide a multitude of different options for the programme, 
                                    depending on level of observance <!--(source)-->. Though the visualisation indicates that Jews by 
                                    religion more commonly participate in external programmes, it is important to remember 
                                    that Jews by religion does not indicate denominational distinctions and even very 
                                    non-observant Jews can identify as religious.</p>

                                    there is little difference between participation numbers across generations. The data is only 
                                    indicative of whether Jewish Americans have ever participated in Jewish organisations, rather 
                                    than if they do in the present. Since most programmes are aimed at a specific age range, the chances 
                                    that a Jewish American participated in such a programme are high. Sunday school and full-time Jewish 
                                    schools encourage a Jewish education whilst Jewish youth groups and camps connect Jews to 
                                    each other <!--(source)-->. What is changing with the current generation is the variety of options 
                                    available to youth as well as continued opportunities provided, as they age. New programmes experienced 
                                    by the millennial generation include the infamous Matzo Ball event in New York City <!--(source)--> and 
                                    <a>Birthright</a> which is only valid for Jews under 26. Opportunities for adults are expanding, including 
                                    synagogue-organised events and dating events and external apps, akin to that of JDate or JSwipe <!--(source)-->, 
                                    are gaining momentum. Whether or not the participation is as high as with youth groups, the fact that more 
                                    options are available already separates millennials from previous generations. Sociologically, youth are 
                                    more impressionable, so the likelihood that maintaining a Jewish identity is much higher if a Jew grows up 
                                    around any semblance of a Jewish community <!--source)-->. </p>

                                    non-Jewish spouses that undergo an orthodox-approved conversion process will be recognised as Jewish and 
                                    the marriage as valid. If the spouse converts after a marriage, they must re-marry in an orthodox ceremony 
                                    for the marriage to be deemed valid <!--(source)-->. Though orthodox rabbis may not recognise an interfaith marriage, 
                                    if the mother is Jewish children from that union will be recognised as Jewish. Preserving the Jewish race faith is 
                                    important, and a non-Jewish spouse risks the loss of both in their Jewish counterpart and future children. 
                                    Another reason why rabbis discourage interfaith marriage is because, other than faith, Judaism is based on a set of 
                                    moral and ethical values which are not guaranteed in a non-Jewish spouse. Marrying outside the faith puts the couple 
                                    on shaky foundation and has a higher chance in resulting in an unsuccessful marriage, though measuring the comparative 
                                    success is difficult <!--(source)-->. In the same vein, rabbis will encourage anyone planning to convert for a marriage
                                    to be completely certain that the conversion would happen regardless. Converting for a person rather than for the 
                                    religion risks the same issues as marrying a non-Jew.</p>

                                <p>Determining whether a child is raised Jewish is an ambiguous task. Just as with identity, the definition for raising 
                                    Jewish children is on a spectrum. Technically, if the mother is Jewish, the child is born a Jew. However, depending 
                                    on what the parent considers to be religious or cultural, the definition of how a child is raised varies. Attending 
                                    <a>synagogue</a> or Sunday School does not automatically equate to a religious upbringing <!--(source)-->.   
                                    <br><br>Sociological studies have attempted to determine how children of immigrants differ from those with parents born 
                                    in the same country. Children of Soviet-born parents can create their Jewish identity, a freedom their parents lacked, 
                                    but growing up with that awareness emphasises the luxury of living in such an environment. Whereas children of American-born 
                                    parents are not necessarily exposed to this difference directly. What this data likely shows are Jewish parents who either 
                                    do not raise their children Jewish or raise them in a different denomination. This most likely stems from a personal 
                                    reassessment of Jewish identity or an interfaith marriage <!--(source)-->. </p>

                                <p>Whether or not children of interfaith marriages are ancestrally Jewish, their upbringing will vary from family to family. 
                                    Dual faith upbringing is common with interfaith marriages. From this, a micro-culture is created with concepts like 
                                    <a>Chrismukkah</a>. Chrismukkah accurately represents children of interfaith marriages who try to combine cultural aspects 
                                    from both sides of their family.  In marriages with conversions, children tend to be brought up <!--(source)--> as
                                    Jewish — culturally, ancestrally and religiously. Most marriages with conversions are done by religious Jews, so religion 
                                    is an integral part of raising the child <!--(source)-->. Alternatively, many Jewish parents in interfaith marriages might 
                                    define themselves as Jewish, but not raise their children Jewish. If it is the mother that is Jewish, the child will be 
                                    ancestrally Jewish, but not recognise that to its full extent due to the lack of religious and cultural Judaism in their 
                                    lives. Data suggests <!--(source)-->  there is a trend of interfaith-marriage children who grow up 
                                    and rediscover their Judaism later in life <!--(source)-->.</p>
