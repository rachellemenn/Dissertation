                                <p> The United States of America was founded on the principle of freedom and, 
                                    by extension, freedom of religion. However, the country’s Christian origins 
                                    have remained a constant dominant in the religious makeup of the United States. 
                                    Today, the Abrahamic monotheistic religions remain the most prominent. 
                                    In the visualisation on the right, the largest circle represents 70 percent 
                                    of religious American who identify as Christian. 
                                    The second largest circle represents other religions and the most prominent of 
                                    those is Judaism at 1.9 percent and Islam at 0.9 percent<!--(PRI [no date]a)-->. While the world 
                                    history of these three religions has often intertwined in messy and unpleasant ways, 
                                    their history within the United States has been slightly different. Though religious 
                                    freedom has not always been total or constant in America — particularly for 
                                    Judaism, Islam and non-Protestant Christian denominations — it is perhaps one of the 
                                    few places in the world these religions have managed relatively successful coexistence<!--(source)-->.
                                    Immigrants from around the world, particularly those fleeing persecution, have 
                                    found solace in the melting pot community of the United States. Such an environment has 
                                    spurred trends of detachment amongst second and third generation children of immigrants

                                <p>Though Jews compose just under 2 percent of the overall United States population, 
                                    it is the largest Jewish community in the world, second to Israel<!--(Dashefsky 2016)-->. 
                                    The perception of America as an asylum for persecuted groups served as the basis for much 
                                    of the immigration to the United States<!--(source)-->. Heavy periods of Jewish immigration 
                                    often occurred in parallel to particularly poor conditions in different areas of the globe. 
                                    Jews have been present in the United States since the 1700s
                                    when <div data-tooltip="V1">Sephardic Jewish</div> immigrants arrived in staggered groups. 
                                    However, the major influxes of Jewish immigrants, in the 1800s and again in the early 20th century, 
                                    mainly consisted of <div data-tooltip="V2">Ashkenazi Jews</div> prompted by bouts of anti-Semitism 
                                    across Eastern Europe<!--(Jewish Virtual Library [no date])-->. Even with the obvious growth of the 
                                    Jewish American community, the absence of an explicit definition of a Jewish identity has posed a 
                                    unique difficulty in collating census data over the last century<!--(Dashefsky 2016)-->.</p>

                                <p>As for many other groups of immigrants, New York served as a hub for Jews. The New York Jewish 
                                    community expanded across the northeast of the United States and, today, the northeast region, 
                                    and New York in particular, hosts the largest Jewish community in the world after Tel Aviv.
                                    The visualisation on the right shows that 58.83 percent of Jews reside on 
                                    the east coast of America. The community in the south of America makes up 20.56 percent
                                    and the west coast 17.08 percent of the Jewish American population. The fewest number
                                    of Jews live in the Midwest with only 8.53 percent. 
                                    Over the years, Jews have spread across the United States, though remain congregated around 
                                    large metropolitan areas. Other notable Jewish American communities include Florida down south 
                                    and LA on the west coast. Jewish populations remain coastal with very few large Jewish populations 
                                    in the Midwest. There are several practical reasons for these concentrations of Jewish communities. 
                                    In addition to better education and employment opportunities, metropolitan areas simplify cultural 
                                    and religious lifestyle requirements. Proximity <div data-tooltip="V4">to a synagogue, within</div> 
                                    walking distance, is vital for more <div data-tooltip="V3">observant Jews</div>, particularly during 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V5">the holidays</div>. Furthermore, the larger a community, the more accessible 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V6">kosher food</div> (in stores and restaurants) becomes – even at establishments 
                                    run by non-Jews. In areas less populated with Jews, lack of access to these amenities makes it 
                                    difficult for those with more observant lifestyles to live comfortably. In addition, living 
                                    around other Jews solidifies a Jewish identity and increases dating and marriage opportunities.
                                    Despite the popularity of metropolitan areas, smaller Jewish communities across the United States 
                                    are growing, due to <div data-tooltip="V7">Hasidic Jews</div> sending missionaries to areas with 
                                    no congregation to build an official community<!--(MJL [no date]a)-->. However, no other areas 
                                    are on par with the communities in New York, Miami and LA. </p>

                                <p>The evolution of the Jewish American identity has been shaped by generational differences in 
                                    experiences and social conditions. Jewish American culture particularly flourished with the 
                                    generation of immigrants that arrived at the beginning of the <div data-tooltip="V8">20th century</div>. 
                                    This group of immigrants became part of the working class as factory workers, seamstresses and small 
                                    business owners<!--(Abrams [no date])-->, of establishments such as the 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V9">Jewish deli</div>, which created the foundation for some of the most well-known 
                                    Jewish-American cultural stereotypes. However, assimilation through education allowed Jews to move up 
                                    in the American class system and resulted in future generations of Jews becoming particularly dominant 
                                    in upper-class professions and some of the top earners in the United States<!--(Burstein 2007)-->.
                                    During this time, many Jewish American leaders encouraged newcomers to embrace Judaism as an ethnic 
                                    and cultural identity rather than emphasise the religious. But by the mid-20th century, religious 
                                    participation increased as more Jews achieved a comfortable position in American society, economically 
                                    and socially<!--(source)-->. The visualisation on the right illustrates that the Jewish American 
                                    population is older
                                    with the silent generation making up 30 percent, baby boomers 31 percent
                                    generation X at 13 percent and millennials at 25 percent. Throughout the last century, 
                                    specific elements of the Jewish American 
                                    identity have fluctuated. Of most concern to Jewish community leaders are the rising 
                                    popularity of interfaith marriages and the increasing disconnect between Jewish Americans and Israel. </p>

                                <p>Procuring an accurate count of Jews is complex partly because Judaism has such a broad definition. 
                                    In the most rudimental terms, a Jewish identity is composed of religion, ancestry and 
                                    culture<!--(Cohen 2010)-->. Abraham, the first of the <div data-tooltip="V10">three patriarchs</div> 
                                    of Judaism, was the first Jew and the ancestor to the entire Jewish nation. Therefore, all Jews are 
                                    bound by an ancestral tie. Judaism states that the biological connection is passed from the mother 
                                    and recognises anyone with a Jewish mother as a Jew, regardless of their religious beliefs. 
                                    Abraham became a Jew because he rejected the pagan religion of his time and devoted 
                                    himself to God. Subsequently, Judaism wholly stems from a belief in God, 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V11">religious scripture and</div> halakhic law, 
                                    both God-mandated and rabbinic. The visualisation on the right represents 
                                    the complexity of the Jewish American
                                    identity. So, despite the firm presence of both religion 
                                    and ancestry in the core of Jewish culture, it is also the manifestation of shared beliefs, 
                                    traditions, history, experiences and circumstance. </p>

                                <p>The three pillars of a Jewish identity — culture, religion and ancestry — are constant, but vary in 
                                    hierarchy and specific elements within every individual. The visualisation on the right 
                                    represents the specific identifications of a 
                                    Jewish identity. In order these are: the Holocaust, leader a moral and ethical
                                    life, observing Jewish law, a sense of humour, fighting for social justice, 
                                    fostering intellect, Jewish food, caring about Israel and community. 
                                    The lighter blue represents religious Jews whilst the darker represents Jews
                                    who do not identify with religion. Though Jewish microcultures directly impact 
                                    an identity; certain personality traits, mannerisms, beliefs and lifestyle choices have become quite 
                                    consistent across nationalities, denominations and generations. For instance, whether there is a 
                                    personal connection to Israel, the potential for a connection is an imperative element of a Jewish 
                                    identity. Furthermore, the collective history of tragedy and oppression is directly reflected in a 
                                    Jewish identity, a concept exhibited in Jewish humour which often takes the form of self-deprecating 
                                    jokes with subtle humorous undertones. This is exemplified in an old Jewish joke which articulates 
                                    that in Jewish tradition, a foetus is not considered viable until after it graduates from medical 
                                    school. This reflects the high demands of parents

                                <p>The connection between certain personality traits and Judaism are not necessarily apparent to all Jews. 
                                        For instance, logical and inquisitive thinking is a trait encouraged in 
                                        <div data-tooltip="V14">the Torah</div>. In oppressive countries,such as the Soviet Union, 
                                        many viewed an education as the only means of surviving in a country unwelcoming 
                                        to the Jewish people. 
                                        Over time, the education become a cultural value as much as a religious value. In the United 
                                        States, this sentiment has translated into parental expectations for children.as can be seen in the visualisation

                                        <!--(Silverman 2008)-->. Such stereotypes are applicable to all Jewish people, but others are 
                                        less universal. <div data-tooltip="V16">The Jewish diaspora</div> separated Jews all around the

                                <p>Freedom of religion allowed American Judaism to flourish in a way that was unfamiliar to 
                                    Jewish immigrants. Though there was no longer an overwhelming fear of persecution for practicing, 
                                    or even admitting to, Judaism, immigrants never completely let go of the fear 
                                    <!--(Pineau and Waters 2015)-->. However, Jewish immigrants became more comfortable in their 
                                    Judaism, and the hesitation gradually dissipated over the last century. More recent generations 
                                    of Jewish Americans differ from their immigrant forbearers because 
                                    they have the choice, and the opportunity, to express their Jewish identity beyond just 
                                    freedom to practice religion. Academics created two broader categories for Jewish identity 
                                    – Jewish by religion (JR) which refers to Jews who consider religion important, and 
                                    Jewish not by Religion (JNR) which refers to Jews who identify primarily with culture 
                                    and ancestry. The visualisation on the right shows that 60.26 percent of Jewish Americans
                                    identity with religious and 38.11 percent identify as Jewish with no religion.
                                    Jewish by religion does not necessarily imply more 
                                    observant<div data-tooltip="V3">denominations</div>. Rather, it encompasses 
                                    Jewish Americans who value the religious aspect of Judaism — regardless if that 
                                    translates to leading an observant life. However, as demonstrated in the visualisation, 
                                    despite the two distinct categories, there is significant overlap between

                                <p>The visualisation on the right breaks down religious and non-religious Jews
                                        by generation. Of religious Jews: 22.42 percent are millennials, 11.97 percent are 
                                        generation X, 30.39 percent are baby boomers and 35.22 percent are of the
                                        silent generation. Of non-religious Jews: 29.49 percent are millennials,
                                        15.6 percent are generation X, 32.26 percent are baby boomers and 22.65 percent
                                        are the silent generation. 
                                        The millennial generation in particular is interesting because
                                        it embodies the evolution of the Jewish American identity over the 
                                        last century. Perhaps more so than previous generations, Jewish American millennials are the 
                                        product of the growing wealth in the Jewish American community. Furthermore, patterns common 
                                        in the millennial generation reflect concerns of Jewish community leaders that there is a 
                                        growing disconnect from Judaism. This is due to higher rates of intermarriage and decreasing 
                                        rates of reproduction, specifically with non-Orthodox Jewish Americans 
                                        <!--(Keysar and Kosmin 2013)-->.
                                        This poses the risk that the Jewish American community is rapidly shrinking. However, despite 
                                        being less religious than previous generations, millennials have a unique access to Judaism that was 
                                        previously unavailable. In the age of the Internet, Jewish Americans can connect to Jews from 
                                        around the world through different online platforms or organisations 
                                        such as <div data-tooltip="V24">Birthright</div>. Physical communities are no longer the 
                                        only option, so Jewish Americans living in smaller Jewish communities still have access 
                                        to other Jews. As a result, cultural Judaism is flourishing amongst 
                                        Jewish American Millennials more than ever before <!--(Mehta 2015)-->. </p>

                                    <!--(source)-->, this is not exclusive to Judaism. Data shows wider patterns of rejecting 
                                    religion across the entire millennial generation. Michael Hout, sociology professor at NYU 
                                    explains that millennials are being raised differently to previous generations, with more 
                                    encouragement towards a mentality of independence and self-thinking <!--(Hout 2016)-->. 
                                    Furthermore, by denouncing religion, millennials are not necessarily rejecting God, but 
                                    traditional institutions. Data demonstrates that millennials are much less trusting of any 
                                    formal institutions, including the government, universities and religious establishments. 
                                    To an extent, a mistrust in formal institutions as well as the provision of freedom of 
                                    thought and religion, by both parents and government, is also applicable to 
                                    Jewish American millennials. However, it does not seem as common afor them to totally 
                                    disassociate themselves with Judaism <!--(Keysar and Kosmin 2013)-->. 
                                    Rather, because Judaism is much more than <div data-tooltip="V4">a synagogue</div> 
                                    and <div data-tooltip="V18">a rabbi</div>, millennials can still maintain their Judaism

                                    59.49 percent of religious Jews were born in America whilst 69.34 were born in
                                     the Soviet Union. Of non-religious Jews, 40.51 percent are American and 30.66 
                                    percent were born in the Soviet Union. 
                                    American-born Jews have had the luxury of growing up without fear of persecution whilst 
                                    Soviet-born Jews grew up in an environment that forced them to hide their Jewish ethnicity 
                                    and, in many cases, their religious beliefs. Whilst the communist regime enforced atheism, 
                                    Jews were always singled out as an independent ethnicity. Anti-Semitism in the USSR was not 
                                    based on religion, but rather highlighted the ancestral and cultural aspects of Judaism. 
                                    It was noted in passports and a quota on Jewish employees and students was enforced by 
                                    companies and universities respectively <!--(Vinogradov 2010)-->.
                                    So, despite a ban on religion, Jews were unable to forget that they were Jewish. 
                                    Though some Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union renounced Judaism completely, many 
                                    chose to focus on their Jewish ethnicity and culture. This both strengthened and 
                                    secularised many traditions which manifested in the production of art, music, literature 
                                    as well as collective values with an emphasis on marrying Jews and receiving an education. 
                                    Whilst there is a larger portion of Jewish millennials with American-born parents, 
                                    there is still a significant portion with immigrant parents. Family is a vital stimulus in

                                    More observant Jews have generally differed from secular Jews in their political ideology. 
                                    Like many Christian denominations within the United States, observant Jews are inclined towards 
                                    a more conservative ideology. Whilst Jews from the Soviet Union tend to lean conservative in resistance 
                                    of left-leaning political views, many religious Jews connect to conservative social policies 
                                    (such as opposition to gay rights). However, it is the conservative backing of the Israeli 
                                    government that attracts the most support for a conservative ideology.
                                    Though Jewish-Americans tend to lean liberal, anti-Israel policies, common in liberal ideology, 
                                    conflicts with the innate support of a Jewish State ingrained into most Jews. 
                                    The differing views intensify the Jewish-American struggle to define its relationship with

                                    34.47 percent were born in the Soviet Union. Those that identify liberal:
                                    23.97 percent were born in American and 38.83 percent were born in the Soviet
                                    Union. Of those that identify as moderate, 43.19 percent were born in America

                                    American Jews have long been stereotyped 
                                    by their political leanings. Though Jews today are no 
                                    longer oppressed, particularly in the United States, they still tend to identify with other 
                                    minorities <!--(Forman [no date])-->. As seen in the visualisation, the majority of 
                                    American-born Jews lean towards a liberal ideology. Soviet-born Jews, on the other hand, 
                                    tend to lean a little more conservative one. This is a trend common in most Soviet immigrants, 
                                    not just Jews. This is because many find the liberal policies to be reminiscent of a communist regime 
                                    — which stemmed from a liberal ideology — and the automatic response is to avoid any similarities to 
                                    that system of government. This has been evident in past elections and Soviet Jews were estimated to

                                    dispelled from the area and attempting to return. This pattern continued throughout history as the 
                                    Jewish people have come and gone from the area <!--(source)-->. In the late 19th century, an activist 
                                    movement called Zionism appeared to fight for the creation of a Jewish state, and today the purpose 
                                    has shifted to fighting for its continued existence and protection.  Like many movements stemmed 
                                    from religion, extremists over the years have falsely synonymised Zionism with Judaism when, 
                                    in fact, Zionism has always been very secular and even anti-religious at times. Originally, 
                                    Zionists were not even interested in the Palestinian area for the Jewish state, but they had 
                                    to adapt their vision upon the realisation that few Jews would commit to a Jewish state 
                                    anywhere else. Although Jews tended to agree with Zionists — that an independent Jewish state 
                                    was a viable solution — some disagreed with the timing (religious Jews believed 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V22">Messiah</div> should come first) and others were focused on 
                                    assimilation to avoid persecution. Even today, many Jews continue 
                                    to clash with Zionists <!--(Barnavi [no date])-->.</p>
                                <p>Israel is unique in that is has become totally intertwined in both cultural and the

                                    to the Jewish people by God, the importance of the state of Israel is entrenched into every Jew. 
                                    But the issue remains that the reality of the Jewish state does not necessarily align with the

                                <p>  Jews have idealised Israel as a utopian homeland where the Jewish people 
                                    could finally come together as one. It has served as both a religious and a cultural symbol of hope to those 
                                    forced into oppressive regimes throughout the Jewish diaspora. However, since its inception in 1948, 
                                    Israel has been in constant conflict with the Palestinians and its neighbouring countries. 
                                    The constant threat to Israel’s survival has created a divide amongst Jews, particularly 
                                    in the United States. Many immigrants came to the States with assimilation as a priority. 
                                    When they found themselves in a country that provided everything the idea of Israel represented, 
                                    the necessity of a Jewish state became less imperative. Though many maintained loyalties to an 
                                    Israeli state, the same sentiments were not necessarily passed down to future generations.  
                                    Furthermore, Jews in other parts of the world, as well as immigrants in the present day, 
                                    have a connection to Israel that is much more defined than that of Jewish Americans

                                <p>Secularised Judaism gained momentum in Europe during the late 19th century

                                    alternative <!--(MJL no date]b)-->. Such circumstances frequently led to Jews 
                                    separating any religious connotations from Jewish traditions and holidays. 
                                    Since Judaism does not require a belief in God 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V4">or synagogue</div> attendance, the secularisation of 
                                    holidays became an important way for Jews to connect to Judaism beyond
                                    just an ancestral connotation. In the Soviet Union, to accommodate to the religious ban, 
                                    the practice of secularising religious traditions was commonplace. As secular 
                                    Judaism developed, it became a way to identify with Judaism without demanding 
                                    belief in God. Secularised interpretations of religious holidays have also 
                                    emphasised the Jewish idea of acknowledging long periods of suffering, 
                                    but celebrating no longer living in such conditions. </p>

                                <p>Passover celebrates the Jewish exodus from slavery in Egypt. Seders are held the 
                                    first two nights of the eight-day holiday. The story of Exodus is told during the 
                                    Seder through symbols, stories, songs and food. Passover Seders are a very communal 
                                    affairs, often bringing family and friends together to celebrate freedom of the Jewish 
                                    people. A more modern Jewish joke tells a story about the time when George W. Bush was 
                                    still president. Faced with an issue he could not solve, Bush decided to reach out to 
                                    history’s sages. One of the people he tried to contact was Moses. He called, he texted, 
                                    he sent WhatsApp messages, but there was no response. Finally, losing patience, Bush 
                                    decided to go to the desert to seek out Moses himself. When he found him, he exclaimed 
                                    “Moses I’ve been trying to contact you for weeks. Why have you been ignoring me?”  
                                    To which Moses responds, “the last time I talked to a bush, I got stuck in the desert 
                                    for 40 years”. This joke references the beginning of the Passover story, when God first 
                                    speaks to Moses through the burning bush. It is a silly joke, but it highlights how 
                                    seemingly religious concepts have become integrated into secular culture. This is 
                                    further demonstrated in the different versions of the Haggadah, the ‘manual’ to a 
                                    Passover Seder, range from abridged to extended forms and demonstrates that Seders 
                                    are not strictly religious. The visualisation on the right shows that 89.093 percent of religious 
                                    Jews attended 
                                    a Seder the previous year and 40.62 percent of non-religious Jews attended a Seder.
                                    10.97 of religious Jews did not attend a Seder and 59.38 of non-religious Jews
                                    did not attend a Seder. Despite the ease of secularising Seders, far more Jews

                                    Since a Jewish identity ranges such a wide spectrum, Jewish communities often extend 
                                    beyond the synagogue. Community – whether the product of shared beliefs or shared

                                <p>Along with encouraging knowledge and awareness of Jewish culture, religion and history, 
                                    Jewish organisations aim to foster a Jewish community. The idea that growing up around a 
                                    community increases the presence of a Jewish community later in life is best demonstrated
                                    by friendships formed. A Jewish joke describes two beggars sitting side by side in a very 
                                    anti-Semitic neighbourhood. One has a sign asking for help for a fellow Jew, the other a 
                                    sign asking for help for a fellow Christian. Naturally, the Christian beggar was getting 
                                    most of the change from everyone that passed. Finally, someone took pity on the Jewish 
                                    beggar and suggested he move neighbourhoods. After the man left, the Jewish beggar turns 
                                    to the Christian beggar and says “Chaim, you hear? He’s trying to teach us to do business!” 
                                    Though the punchline relies on an old stereotype, the sentiment remains. Jewish friends 
                                    reinforce Judaism. The majority of those who have mostly or some Jewish friends later 
                                    in life, also participated in Jewish organisations. It simplifies finding other Jews 
                                    which can prove difficult in non-Jewish communities. </p>

                                    Jews and Canaanites for fear that any resulting children would adopt the Canaanite faith. 
                                    Rabbinical law extrapolated this to all non-Jews, forbidding any interfaith marriage at all 
                                    <!--(source)-->. The extremity to which this is upheld varies by denomination. Though 
                                    community acceptance varies by sect, more reform and reconstructionist rabbis will recognise 
                                    and even agree to perform an interfaith marriage ceremony whilst orthodox rabbis will not. 
                                    However, potential non-Jewish spouses that undergo an orthodox-approved conversion process 
                                    will be recognised as Jewish and the marriage as valid. If the spouse converts after a 
                                    marriage, they must re-marry in an orthodox ceremony for the marriage to be 
                                    deemed valid<!--(source)-->. Though orthodox rabbis may not recognise an interfaith marriage, 
                                    if the mother is Jewish, children from that union will be recognised as Jewish as well. 
                                    Preserving the Jewish race and faith is important, and a non-Jewish spouse risks the loss 
                                    of both in their Jewish counterpart and future children. Another reason why rabbis discourage 
                                    interfaith marriage is because, other than faith, Judaism is based on a set of moral and 
                                    ethical values which are not guaranteed in a non-Jewish spouse. Marrying outside the faith 
                                    puts the couple on shaky foundation and has a higher chance in resulting in an unsuccessful 
                                    marriage, though measuring the comparative success is difficult <!--(PRI 2013c)-->.</p>
                                    <p>In the same vein, rabbis will encourage anyone planning to convert for a marriage to be 
                                    completely certain that the conversion would happen regardless. Converting for a person 
                                    rather than for the religion risks the same issues as marrying a non-Jew.</p>

                                <p>The visualisation on the right demonstrates that 85.52 percent 
                                        of religious Jews are married to a Jew.
                                        62.45 percent of non-religious Jews are not married to another Jew.
                                        Like most things in Judaism, the reasons for marrying Jewish are not distinct. The term 
                                        interfaith implies religion and does not adequately encompass the wider importance of marrying 
                                        a Jew. Though it is instructed in the Torah and halakhic law, the roots of this tradition are in 
                                        preserving ancestry. Even in oppressive countries, amongst secularised communities, marrying Jewish 
                                        was often the one obligation regularly enforced <!--(source)-->.  Parental regulation of who their child 
                                        marries is often associated with the <div data-tooltip="V12">Jewish mother stereotype</div>. An old 
                                        Jewish joke quips that a Jewish man needs two women in a marriage—a single Jewish girl and a concerned 
                                        Jewish mother. Though religion itself plays a small role in the importance behind the tradition, the 
                                        concept seems to be most instilled in religious Jews whereas numbers are not as consistent with 
                                        non-religious Jews. The fact that the question was asked implies the huge cultural significance 
                                        marriage holds. The growing number of interfaith marriages, however, demonstrates better the 
                                        gradual shift towards a more secular Judaism in the United States.</p>

                                <p>Determining whether a child is raised Jewish is an ambiguous task. Just as with identity, 
                                    the definition for raising Jewish children is on a spectrum. Technically, if the mother is 
                                    Jewish, the child is born a Jew. However, depending on what the parent considers to be 
                                    religious or cultural, the definition of how a child is raised varies. 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V4">Attending synagogue</div> or Sunday School does not automatically 
                                    equate to a religious upbringing. Sociological studies have attempted to 
                                    determine how children of immigrants differ from those with parents born in the 
                                    same country as themselves. Children of Soviet-born parents can create their Jewish identity, 
                                    a freedom their parents lacked, but growing up with that awareness 
                                    emphasises the luxury of living in such an environment. Whereas children of American-born 
                                    parents are not necessarily exposed to this contrast in lifestyles directly. What this data 
                                    likely shows are Jewish parents who either do not raise their children Jewish or raise them 
                                    as a different <div data-tooltip="V3">denomination</div>.
                                    This most likely stems from a personal reassessment of Jewish 
                                    identity or an interfaith marriage <!--(Cooperman and Smith 2013)-->.</p>

                                <p>Whether or not children of interfaith marriages are ancestrally Jewish, their upbringing 
                                    will vary from family to family. Dual faith upbringing is common with interfaith marriages. 
                                    From this, a micro-culture is created with concepts like 
                                    <div data-tooltip="V34">Chrismukkah</div>. Chrismukkah accurately represents children of 
                                    interfaith marriages who try to combine cultural aspects from both sides of their family. 
                                    In marriages with conversions, children tend to be brought up as Jewish — culturally, 
                                    ancestrally and religiously. Most marriages with conversions are done by religious Jews, 
                                    so religion is an integral part of raising the child. Alternatively, many Jewish parents 
                                    in interfaith marriages might define themselves as Jewish, but not raise their children 
                                    Jewish. If it is the mother that is Jewish, the child will be ancestrally Jewish, but not 
                                    recognise that to its full extent due to the lack of religious and cultural Judaism in 
                                    their lives. Data suggests there is a trend of interfaith-marriage children growing up

                                <p>There’s a Jewish joke that tells of a reunion between two old friends in Miami Beach. 
                                    Sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean on a late Shabbat afternoon, the two catch up. 
                                    Eventually, Jacob’s expression turns serious and he addresses his old friend: 
                                    “Shmuel, I’ve been hearing you don’t go to synagogue anymore. Is this true? 
                                    Have you lost belief in God?” Shmuel, looking visibly uncomfortable, avoids the question 
                                    and hurriedly brings up another subject. The next day, the friends decide to meet up again. 
                                    Sitting on the same bench, looking over the same ocean, Jacob asks the same question: 
                                    “Shmuel please tell me, have you stopped believing in God?” Without hesitation, Shmuel 
                                    replies, “Yes, I have.”  Confused, Jacob asks why Shmuel couldn’t have told him the 
                                    same thing yesterday. Shmuel looks appalled, 
                                    “God forbid, on Shabbat?”<!--(source)--> </p>
                                <p>The anecdote exemplifies the growing shift away from religion that has become a 
                                    constant in Jewish American culture over the years. But it also highlights the 
                                    difficulty in isolating any single element of the Jewish identity. Though the Jewish 
                                    community continues to grow more and more concerned that the Jewish identity in the 
                                    United States is rapidly fading, it has been made apparent that this is not the case.
                                    Though the Jewish American identity may look different from a century ago, the Jewish 
                                    identity has always fluctuated.  The Jewish identity continues to be nourished—even if 
                                    religion is emphasised less than in previous generations. But the modern day Jewish 
                                    American identity also emphasises the cohesiveness of ancestry, culture and religion. 
                                    Regardless of how it might manifest itself in a Jewish American’s life — each element 
                                    is present and matters.</p>

            Sephardi is one of the predominant Jewish sub-ethnicities. Sephardic Jews are
            originally from regions that form modern day Spain and Portugal, but were expelled
            during the Spanish Inquisition, often to areas with no other Jewish communities
            such as West Asia and North Africa. Today, Sephardic Jews also refers to Jewish
            communities from these parts of the world. Sephardic Jews have their own
            rabbinical council which has resulted in slightly different laws and variations of
            Jewish traditions. Sephardic Jews established some of the first Jewish communities
            in the United States, dating back to pre-colonial times. There was no mass
            immigration of Sephardic Jews, like those from Eastern Europe. Rather they trickled
            in. Today, the United States has the third largest Sephardic Jewish community in the
            world. <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/ashkseph.htm" target="_blank">Learn More</a>

            from consistent anti-Semitism and oppression, Ashkenazi Jews played a significant

            the Yiddish language, a mix of German and Hebrew, from which many words have
            become commonplace, not just amongst Jews, but in colloquial English (i.e.
            schmuck). Huge influxes of Ashkenazi Jews came to America at various points, the
            most influential of which were the immigrants at the beginning of the 20th century.

            Judaism is split into four main religious movements – Orthodox, Conservative,
            Reconstructionist and Reform (the survey used as a basis for this project grouped
            the reconstructionist and reform movements together). The movements differ
            primarily on levels of observance and the interpretations of religious scripture and
            Jewish laws. Each denomination is further divided into different sects. Within the
            orthodox movement, there are many different sects all with very specific
            interpretations and complexities associated with each particular one. For instance,
            observant Jews, specifically orthodox, employ a dress code, keep kosher and
            observe Shabbat – but these might take different forms depending on the sect.

            A synagogue is the Jewish house of assembly used for prayer, study of the Torah and
            for community gatherings. A synagogue is not imperative for prayer. Jewish law
            dictates that a minyan, ten men, need to be present, anywhere, in order to conduct
            group prayers. Though most praying can be done individually, a minyan is required
            to read the Torah and for certain holidays. The minimal traditional expectations of a
            synagogue include: a bimah (a platform from which the Torah is read and a rabbi
            conducts prayer) and an arc containing the Torah. Traditionally, both the bimah and
            the arc are situated so that the congregation faces east, towards Israel, during
            prayer. Whether Jerusalem is actually east is a point of argument.

            Keeping kosher refers to following the Jewish dietary requirements as outlined by

            be consumed (the most well-known items include pork and shellfish) and killed in a
            specific way. It is also forbidden to mix dairy with meat. Fish, eggs and all other food
            items are considered ‘pareve’, meaning neither dairy or meat. Kosher kitchens have
            separate dishes and cooking utensils for dairy and meat. If possible, separate sinks
            and counters are used or even two kitchens. In more modern times, the definition of
            kosher has extended to rabbi supervision for the preparation of processed or
            packaged foods, and regular inspections of any kosher establishments. The degree
            of strictness varies between sub-ethnicities, denominations and individual
