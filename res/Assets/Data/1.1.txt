"The United States of America was founded on the principle of freedom and, within this, freedom of religion. However, the country’s Christian origins have remained a constant dominant in the religious makeup of the United States. Today, monotheistic religions remain the most prominent with 70 percent of religious citizens Christian, 1.9 percent Jewish and 0.9 percent Muslim (source). While the history of these three religions has often intertwined in messy and unpleasant ways, their history within the United States is slightly different. Though promised religious freedom has not always been constant, particularly for Judaism, Islam and non-Protestant Christian denominations, the United States is perhaps one of the few places in the world where the existence of the three religions has been mostly harmonious (source). Immigrants, particularly those fleeing persecution, from around the world have found solace in the melting pot community in the United States. The ability to co-exist has led second and third generation children to a common trend of detachment from the experiences their families and ancestors faced outside of the United States."
