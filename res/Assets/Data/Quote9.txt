"The seders that I have been part of are powerful to me because they are secular, because we can repurpose or refocus the symbols. \n The past few years have emphasized refugees, which is something meaningful to me. For me, these traditions are cultural, but they are so often based in symbols and stories, and those can be applied in many ways."
