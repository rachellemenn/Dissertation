I grew up in an interfaith household (mother is Jewish and father was raised Presbyterian) \n and felt that the interfaith nature of my childhood actually led to a stronger connection to Judaism as an adult. … \n I feel very lucky to have been granted full ownership of my religious identity in this sense, \n but it has interestingly made me feel even more strongly about raising my kids Jewish, whether or not I marry a Jew.
