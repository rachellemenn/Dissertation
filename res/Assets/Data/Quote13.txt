"<p>My grandfather used to call America a country of fearless idiots. As a Jew from the Soviet Union, he grew up in an oppressive environment where he had to hide who he was. But as a Jewish American, I’ve grown up in a country that celebrates individuality. I’ve been able to connect to Judaism through religion and culture. My family’s experience puts my own into perspective, but it also highlights how lucky I am to live in an open Jewish community with all kinds of different Jews. It’s allowed me to cultivate my own Jewish identity and I’m so proud to share it.</p>"
