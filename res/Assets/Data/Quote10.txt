"<p>I consider my Judaism both my religion and my ethnicity. I have a stronger connection to the religious aspects of being a Jew than most of my millennial Jewish friends do, but I still think that the majority of our traditions truly do combine religious with cultural.</p> <br /> <p>Fasting on Yom Kippur, for instance, makes me feel closer to the Jewish community around me - I fast for religious reasons ... but the experience of fasting is a cultural one as well.</p>"
