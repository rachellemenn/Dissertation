"I valued my Judaism and understood that I would need to marry Jewish in order to cultivate those values as someone wanting a family in the future. \n I wanted to continue learning and growing in my faith and having a life partner with that same desire makes that possible … \n Converting to Judaism is incredibly difficult and that it will only last if the person would have converted whether or not the relationship continued.  \n Sometimes love is not enough, and when communication breaks down and all we have are our base values, it's good to have a similar core so that you still share values other than your love for each other."
