I never really gave it much though[t], being Jewish didn’t really mean much to me until my early twenties, \n I’m sure I looked at being Jewish as being a disadvantage in my earlier years. One day things just changed, I became more and more interested in what my heritage was, how lucky I was that my family had moved to the United States in the early 1900s from Ukraine and Lithuania ... \n I felt such a strong connection to the stories I was told by my bubby. \n I knew I had to be part of a larger community. I knew I had to try to keep kosher which would have been impossible in Virginia. I knew I had to be around other Jews, I knew I had to move to Baltimore.
