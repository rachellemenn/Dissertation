Working for justice and equality is an undeniably Jewish pursuit. \n Judaism is full of lessons and values that directly relate to social justice \n and I was raised to consider social justice advocacy an essential element of being a Jew. \n I think that American Jews have a specific obligation to fight for justice and equality given the relative safety and security with which we've grown up in the US.
